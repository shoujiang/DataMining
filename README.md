Mining Frequent Patterns of News
In this project, you are going to mine the frequent patterns (sort terms, just set k=2,
3,4) of news and the similarity of documents (use the BBC Datasetshttp://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html). 
Locality Sensitive Hashing is recommended to use for dimensionality reduction
